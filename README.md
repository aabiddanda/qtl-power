# Power Calculation Routines for GWAS Study Design

## Installation

If you are interested in installing this package for direct use within scripts or notebooks, please run:

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/data-analysis5/qtl-power.git
cd qtl-power
pip install .
```

to install directly from source.

## Interactive Exploration via Notebooks

If you are primarily interested in a more interactive experience, you can immediately use several of our pre-built notebooks via the [`mybinder`](https://mybinder.org/v2/gl/data-analysis5%2Fqtl-power/default?labpath=notebooks%2F) link above. This will allow you to use the library to generate commonly used plots for comparing power for genetic association based on mutliple input parameters.


## Documentation

Currently the documentaton is held in the `/docs` directory and is built using [`Sphinx`](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). To rebuild the documentation:

```
cd docsrc
make clean html copy
cd ..
git add docs/
```

then create a commit that will create an updated set of documentation.
